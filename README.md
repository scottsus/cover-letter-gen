# Cover Letter Generator

This is a very simple cover letter generator. Will build a UI for this soon.

## Quick Start

1. Setup venv and install packages

   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Use your OpenAI key

    ```
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx
    ```

3. If you have an example of a good cover letter, put it in `example.md`.

4. For every job description, paste it in `job_desc.md`.

5. Run the script
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

Goodluck with your job search friend ðŸ«¶
